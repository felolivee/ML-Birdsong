# ML-Birdsong

Bengalese finches are songbirds used as a model organism for human language learning. They sing distinct syllables that we can use to measure the acquisition of vocal motor skills. However, a significant challenge lies in manually labeling the syllables in the birds' songs. This project aims to test various machine learning classification models to optimize syllable identification and reduce human bias inherent to manual labeling.
